1.What is this?
>Everyone loves to travel but only a few do it. What if you did travel only to find out that your destination has bad weather, that's a nightmare. So we made this simple app to solve this problem.

> This is a decision-making web app which gives you information about weather in the region you want to celebrate your holiday.

> This web application takes the destination and the date you would be there as input.

> And shows you the weather of the next 10days and analyses the weather and tells you weather you should make the journey or not.

2.How it Works?
>  Our web app fetches weather information from visualcrossing weather API.

> We have used Javascript for other calculations such as it tells you the number of days it’s cloudy or sunny etc.

3.How to Use it?
> The user interface is simple to understand and in addition, we have added the Instructions page so it’s super easy to use.

> Its just 3 simple steps
	1.Enter your destination.
	2.select the date you want to be there.
	3.now just click on submit.
And that’s it.

Our web app will give you a decision so that you can make your perfect holiday. . :)
